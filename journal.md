### review

Manifest of humanity for humanity from Neil Postman. He shares his few big with ideas us.

The first one is the idea of introspection and reflection; that is the idea of being mindful when evaluating life, decisions, tools, words, behaviors of ours and others.

The second idea is the idea of finding the new narrative; that is a meta-purpose to our lives and the existence of humankind. 
He hints that idea of continuity of human race, which can be achieved through understanding of oneness between not only human beings but between humans and Nature, may be the answer. 
Idea of continuity should transcend one's life (everyone should become \"smaller\") and time (we should be fill continuity with the greats of the past and future).

The third big idea is the idea of importance of history. Postman demonstrates by example how history might have not only origins for our problems but also ideas how to solve them. History is a tool that scales down time, that is making us smaller, and allows us to see bigger picture and have bigger ideas.

The fourth big idea and hope from Postman is to show us that we can change things. He shows that ideas were created and implemented by real people. 
He suggest that we shouldn't blindly follow the flow of history, because there is no such flow. We should alter it (at the capacities available to humans) based on the values and idea we believe in.

The final idea is the idea of choosing correct tools and frameworks. He suggest Scientific method to us. In his book he tries to provide us with good tools that help us evaluate everything else. 
Neil Postman's book is a work of ultimate importance in the post-modern world. 
The absence of the Narrative, forgetfulness of smaller good ideas and lost of ideals causing some lack of belief in the bright future. 
Postman, as a true philosophe, tries to use his intellect, following the tradition of Voltaire, Rousseau, Locke, Hume, Jefferson, and others, to give us practical examples how we can change things for the better.

### review

Outstanding analysis of American culture of 1980s dominated by entertainment.

Makes a lot of sense to me since I witnessed myself similar changes to the culture growing up in Ukraine during the 1990s and 2000s.

This book is even more actual now in the age of Internet, mobile phones, social networks, instant deliveries etc.


## What I Talk About When I Talk About Running

### review

Very personal memoir by Haruki Murakami that covers 30 something years of his life: after he became a writer and started to run.

Few interesting things that I noticed:

 - Murakami shows his struggles with getting older.
 Aging is such an important topic that touches everyone often not talked about. 
 Seeing your result getting worth with age is a good way to be aware of time in life. 
 It keeps you focused on the crucial thing and helped you appreciate life.
 
 - I appreciated how he put the duration of human life in a better perspective.
 He became a writer after being 33 years old. He sold his bar, quit smoking, changed his diet, started writing and running. 
 The best part of the life for him began after he became true to himself in the mid-30s.
 
 - Murakami emphasizes how for him life is the process of knowing himself better.
 Knowing what he likes, what is crucial for him. 
 His focus is on internal matters and not external things. 
 He decides to spend as much time with people he likes and avoid people he dislikes. 
 He is not competitive because for him competitiveness is about looking outward not inward.

 - Another valuable lesson: everything worthy in life requires a big effort.
 He shows how setting up routine and rules for himself was paramount.

### review

Collection of essays on different topics from education, childhood, politics, technology, television etc. 
Postman, as always, provides insights into our culture (mostly American) and suggests some practical ideas how to prevent negative ongoing trends. As always he uses wisdom of sages, thinkers, writers, and philosophers from the past to help us understand current social issues.

His essays and observations draw a picture of quite sad future. A lot of this predications are already fulfilled, so Postman is unfortunately was very accurate in them which he poses as warnings for us.

However, what I liked about this book is that he tries to stay optimistic. He reminds us that civilized society is very vulnerable and we should pay attention to dangers. And he tries to provide us with a mindset how to do just that.

### review

Personal account of Spanish war by George Orwell.

Couple of insights:

- Stalinist tactics used in Spain were as terrible as in USSR
- Press is extremely important in influencing events

What was interesting is that Orwell few times pointed out that his account is not fully objective and that reader should not believe his words without verification. 
This is great example of professionalism. 
Orwell recognizes both his subjectivity but also his duty to the public. 
Seems like not many people back then and now do this.

Also, I really like that Orwell was optimistic even in the end. 
He was wounded, needed to leave country, but at the end he still believed in human nature and better future.

### review

A comprehensive history of Russian revolution in a short, simple book that anyone can understand. 
I think in this fact lies the beauty of Orwellâ€™s work. 
People of all ages can appreciate and visualize even the most complex social changes.

It seems that Orwell did describe Russian revolution very closely with fall of the capitalist empire, communist revolution, Marx, collectivization, fight between Trotsky and Stalin, dictatorship and full counter-revolution and come back to the similar state as it was before 1917 but with a different name.

Also, it seems, that even if it accounts for the Russian revolution, the pattern is the same for all them. 
This book is a reminder to us how events usually unfold and what happens at the end. 
And what kind of people typically end-up on top in any system regarding of the title.


## To the Castle and Back

### review

Havel is a role model. 
He shows us what a public figure, a politician and a citizen can be. 
He is definitely not afraid to think deeper and to express himself. 
He is not afraid to formulate unpopular opinions. 
He tries to understand pluses and minuses of each system. 
E.x. he is for continous political integration, but he thinks globalization is a problem. 
He recognized the pitfalls of both Soviet regime and consumerism society that both causes normalization and standartization of people.

It was interesting for me to read his book for several reasons: 

- to learn his story
- to learn about his thoughts
- to take a look at his diary

The diary of the President was an interesting read on itself. 
It contained his agenda for a lot of days and it showed him as a real simple very likable human, which is quite opposite of the politicians of the day.

Havel wanted to be a role model. 
He wanted to remind his fellow citizens of better and bigger ideals, he wanted to inspire them to improve. 
Politicians of today mostly move in opposite direction. 
They just represent the worst parts of our society and our people. 
If society is corrupt, politicians are corrupt. 
If society is uneducated, politicians are profane.

### review

One of the most beautiful and simple books about life, love, death; 
about being a child and being an adult; about friendship, people and happiness.

When I was in 10th grade at school, I remember literature teacher was very enthusiastic about this book. 
She was telling us about it all the time. 
I didn't find it interesting back then. 
I didn't understand the story about little prince, talking foxes, flowers and snakes. 
Form didn't appeal to me and I probably had nothing to learn from it at that time. 
This time was different. I would recommend this book to everyone. 
It's a pure beauty. Just in few pages it shows what is important in life and what is not.

### review

Nasim Taleb seems like a very smart person but:

- book was exremely long, especially to present one main idea
- the style is quite arrogant, which I didn't enjoy at all

I liked that he quoted a lot of people in his book, but because of 2 reasons stated above I'm not looking forward to read his other books. 
It was very painful experience and took me half a year to finish it.

Good read if you want to have insight about life of startup founder, product manager/engineer in the Silicon Valley. Has a lot of pretty intimate details and a lot of humor (but not the type I like).

The book itself is too long. Easily can be done in 10 blog posts or shorter stories.

Outstanding book with a lot of wisdowm and personal discoveries. 
Bruce Lee connects East and West.

Reminds me of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. 
It's both a diary and collecion of insights that can be open and read any day.

### review

Great book that briefly explains history of organizations and shows us how organizations of the future would look like.

It describes requirenments for the organizations of the future and some practical advices how to set the up.

However, I found book a bit longer than needed. It had double focus: both theory and a lot of practical case studies, and that seemed too much for me.

### review

Book describes habits of individuals, organizations and societies. 
It was interesting to read, but at the end I didn't get many insights that would remain with me for a long time.

The book easily could have been shorter.

### review

Great distopia written in early XX century. Suprisingly the world in the last 30 years become very close to the one described by Huxley.

The best book that explains Brave New World is Amusing Ourlselves to Death by Neil Postman.

Tiny book which is basically collection of quotes and small passages about mediums.
Some insights are quite good, but majority are very difficult to decompress and unbundle.

### review

Introduction to Buddhism and especially Zen Buddhism. Very easy explanation of the core concepts.

I really like the idea that Buddhism is Hinduism for export, that is Hinduism that stripped from culture and can be used as religion by people of different cultures.

Too simple and too tied to the things that were going on in the USA during 2016.
My expectations were much higher, especially given authors background as a historian.

### review

Very short and simple book. Didn't find a lot of interesting things when read.
However, I think it's an interesting book to be written at 1839.
Also the topic is as relevant as always and insights are true and common knowledge now.

The book laid out the history of the region and history scientific inqury into it. 
I've read it just in few days and couldn't stop reading.

## Havel on critizing

authors: @{VÃ¡clav Havel}  
tags: #{politics, criticizing}  

### sources

book                   | pages | chapter
---------------------- | ----- | ---------
To the Castle and Back | 5     | Chapter 1 

### quote

People told me exactly what I would later often say to others when tring to draw them into politics: 
you can't spend your whole life criticizing something and then, 
when you have the chance to do it better, refuse to go near it.


## Postman on promotion of fast technological solutions

authors: @{Neil Postman}  
tags: #{technology, television commercials, utopia}  

### quote

Television screens saturated with commercials to promote the Utopian and childish idea that all problems have fast, simple, and technological solutions.


## Balzac on consumption

authors: @{HonorÃ© de Balzac}  
tags: #{consumption, coffee, alchohol, drugs}

### sources

book                           | pages | chapter
------------------------------ | ----  | ---------------------
Treatise on Modern Stimulants  | 6     | I The Subject at Hand

### quote

Excessive consumption of tobacco, coffee, opium and spirits produces grave disorders and drives one to an early death. The organs, endlessly irritated, endlessly nourished, become hypertrophied; they become 
abnormally enlarged, damanged and corrupt the machine, which succumbs.
